**Importing data and necessary libraries**.  

Data set downloaded from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/redpen12/employees-satisfaction-analysis  
The data used in this project contains employee ID, satisfaction level, last performance evaluation, numbers of project total, average monthly hour, year with company, promotion within last 5 years, work accident, department(10 departments total), and salary type (low, medium, high).  

A few libraries needed for this project are:  

- Cleaning and analyzing data: dplyr, reshape, reshape2, tidyverse, modelr.  

- Visualizing data: ggplot2, RColorBrewer, ggpubr.  

Goal and process of project: 

- Goal: to determine which factor affects the satisfaction level the most, and the reason why.   

- Process: 

-- Step 1: Compare satisfaction level with last performance evaluation. 

-- Step 2: Detect outliers (if any). 

-- Step 3: Show current satisfaction level associates with each factor (department, salary type, work accident, promotion, average monthly hour, time spend with company, number of project) to see which factor has more uneven pattern. 

-- Step 4: When factor(s) is/are determined from above, show any possible relationship between factors.  

-- Step 5: Perform deeper analysis from here, based on results in step 4.
